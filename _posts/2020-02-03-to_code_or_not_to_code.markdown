To Code or Not to Code. I've always had an interest in software engineering but what does that entail? I mean, the name alone screams professionalism and is appealing as a career path but I actually never understood what I could gain from learning how to code. As I advanced in my career, I dabbled in web design and I fell in love. Some things you want to do and suck at and other things your great at but don't exactly want to do. Here I was with a new found talent that I actually enjoyed. So, in my spare time I design websites and work on more of the front-end. That can always be perfected, but I figured... why not learn how to build websites and apps on my own!? 

Ahhh...another bright idea! 

When the opportunity presented itself, I was all in. I decided to go for it. I also realized the advantages that having this skill comes with. The opportunity to work independently, yet still within teams; working from anywhere that has wifi and internet service, having the freedom to travel and create more work/life balance and of course, knowing and understanding a trade that is in high demand now and continuously growing. What is there not to love? I have to admit, I have been challenged throughout the past 2 weeks more than I have ever been challenged in my entire career and education combined. Holding a Masters Degree holds absolutely no weight at this point! I might as well be fresh out of elementary school. However, I am definitely feeling confident that I am up for the challenge and I pray that it starts to become second nature for me. In a sense, I really feel like I'm learning a new language.
